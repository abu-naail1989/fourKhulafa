          Abu Bakr was always a very close Companion of the Holy Prophet, he
          knew him better than any other man. He knew how honest and upright the
          Prophet was. Such knowledge of the Prophet made Abu Bakr be the first
          man to follow the Message of Prophet Muhammad sallallahu 'alayhi wa
          sallam. He was indeed the first adult male to accept Islam. The Holy
          Prophet told Abu Bakr what had happened at Mount Hira', he told him
          that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala had revealed to him and made him His
          Messenger. When Abu Bakr heard this from the Prophet sallallahu
          'alayhi wa sallam, he did not stop to think, he at once became a
          Muslim. He submitted to Islam with such determination that once the
          Holy Prophet himself remarked, "I called people to Islam, everybody
          thought over it, at least for a while, but this was not the case with
          Abu Bakr, the moment I put Islam before him, he accepted it without
          any hesitation." He was titled as-Siddiq by the Prophet because his
          faith was too strong to be shaken by anything. In fact, Abu Bakr was
          more than a great believer, as soon as he became a Muslim, he
          immediately began to preach Islam to others. Among those who accepted
          Abu Bakr's invitation to Islam were 'Uthman, Az-Zubayr, Talhah,
          'Abdur-Rahman ibn Awf, Sa'ad ibn Waqqas and others who later became
          the pillars of Islam. Abu Bakr's love of the Prophet sallallahu
          'alayhi wa sallam was so great that he was willing to sacrifice his
          life for the sake of protecting and comforting the Prophet saw. Such
          love and sacrifice were demonstrated when one day the Holy Prophet was
          saying his prayers in the Ka'bah, while some of the chiefs of Makkah
          were sitting in the court yard of the Ka'bah. Seeing the Prophet
          praying, 'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'it took a long piece of cloth and put it
          around the Prophet's neck and twisted it hard in an attempt to
          strangle the Prophet sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam to death. At that
          moment Abu Bakr happened to pass by from a distance, he saw 'Uqbah
          trying to strangle the Prophet to death. Immediately Abu Bakr ran to
          the help of the Prophet, he pushed 'Uqbah aside and took the cloth
          from aroundthe Prophet's neck. Thereupon the enemies of Islam came
          down upon Abu Bakr and beat him unmercifully, although Abu Bakr with
          faith like a rock did not care for his own suffering, he was glad that
          he was able to save the Prophet of Allah, even at the risk of his own
          life. Abu Bakr with the wealth he had, also had a major role in
          freeing some of the Muslim slaves, who were barbarically tortured by
          their heartless Mushrik masters to give up the faith and return to
          their masters' beliefs. The heartless monsters tried all kinds of
          torture: they made them lie all naked on the burning desert sand,
          putting big stones on their chest, as well as other kinds of torture.
          Here Abu Bakr's wealth came to the rescue, as he bought the poor
          helpless slaves from their inhuman masters and set them free, Bilal
          al-Habashi, the slave of 'Umayyah ibn Khalaf, was among those who were
          set free by Abu Bakr. Bilal became afterwards the mu'adhin at the
          Prophet's mosque. Migration to Madinah
